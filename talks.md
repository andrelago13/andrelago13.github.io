# Talks

This is a collection of the talks I have hosted over the last few years. When I was younger I was very shy and afraid of public speaking, but as I grew I became more confident in it and now I truly enjoy the opportunities I have to speak to audiences. I have spoken about many topics, mostly focusing on career development and my daily work, and I look forward to having even more chances to do so in the future!

## To Be Announced, Porto (early 2020)

More details on my latest talk coming soon :)

## "Building Privacy for the User" at [European Cyber Security Month](https://www.meetup.com/gdg-munich/events/264756824/), Munich (Oct 21, 2019)

Building efficient privacy tools is essential in order to meet the user's expectations and provide them with control over their data. Because of this, it's extremely important to design privacy products in a way that fulfills the needs of the users and provides them positive value. In this talk we'll go through the history behind some of Google's main privacy products, describing some of the processes through which we design and develop them.

## "Life of a Software Engineer at Google" at [Job IT](http://jobit.pt/), Porto (Apr 24, 2019)

Learn about what life is like as a Software Engineer at Google: not just the food, fun and other perks, but most importantly what are the practices that make Google's products great and that help us improve as engineers!

## Opening and closing keynotes and speaker introductions at [Talk A Bit](https://talkabit.org/2018/), Porto (Jan 20, 2018)

I served as the Conference Chair for the 2018 edition of Talk a Bit, a tech conference hosted every year at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto. I wrote more about this experience [in my blog](/blog/managing-a-tech-conference). As Conference Chair, I was also responsible for delivering the opening and closing keynotes of the conference in which I talked about the goal of the conference and about how technology can have a huge impact on society (the main theme of the conference).

## Company introduction for Devenire at [LGP 2017](http://lgp.fe.up.pt/wordpress/?lang=en), Porto (Jun 2, 2017)

In 2017 I was the CEO of a simulated company with ~50 students, developing 4 different projects with clients that were real companies (an experience I write more about [in my blog](/blog/tales-of-a-ceo)). At the end of the course, each company had to deliver a presentation where they should not only explain each of the developed projects we had to pitch what was the vision and identity of the company. As the CEO, I was responsible for delivering this speach at the beginning of our company's presentation.
