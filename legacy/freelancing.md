# What do I do as a freelancer?

As a freelancer, I'm available to work on all sorts of projects but I prefer working on medium-to-longer term projects over shorter projects of just a couple of days as that's the kind of projects where I can have more impact due to my past experience with large scale projects.

In cases where a project either is too large for me to handle by myself or requires an area that I'm not so comfortable with, I'm able to coordinate with a hand-picked team of freelancers that I trust so that my customers don't have to take that added responsibility, if they choose to do so.

I'm very flexible with customer requirements for projects. I can work both on an hourly rate or a per-project budget which I can provide before-hand. We can also coordinate on the timeline for projects as well as milestone deliveries depending on your preference. I'm perfectly comfortable signing NDAs or other similar agreements to address any security concerns you may have.

Here are some examples of projects that would fit my skill-set well:

- API that serves data from your internal systems to either other internal systems or 3rd parties, with standardized interface protocols, automatic documentation and automated testing.
- automated data processing system that fetches data from one or more providers and processes it to the format your existing systems require.
- definition of the architecture for large-scale systems you're considering building. These could include proof-of-concept examples, written documentation to explain the recommended decisions or even building of such systems.
- scrapper of publicly available data sources for use in your internal systems.

Here's a sample of some technologies I'm most familiar working with (**NOTE**: as I mentioned above, I have a broader team of other freelancers I can work with, so if your project requires other areas talk to me about it as I might still be able to find a solution):

- Programming Languages: Typescript, Javascript, Java, Python, C++, C#, Golang
- Frameworks: Node.js, React.js, Angular, Spring
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Cloud: AWS (DynamoDB, API Gateway, RDS, ECS, S3, Lambda, Step Functions), Google Cloud (Firestore, Cloud Functions)
- Orchestration/Productization: Docker, Docker Compose
