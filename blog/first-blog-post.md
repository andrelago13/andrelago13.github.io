Hi!

I decided to create this website, along with the blog, as a way to not only display my skills and experiences, but also to share any thoughts that I might find useful for other people.

Since this is the first post of the blog, I think I should describe myself a little, so, on to the introductions:

Iâ€™m AndrÃ© ðŸ™‚ Iâ€™m from Portugal and I study Computer Engineering at the University of Porto. I love computer science, itâ€™s one of my biggest passions, and I know for sure that I want to work on technology because Iâ€™m just too big of a fan of it! I still feel the same excitement I used to feel as a kid when I learn about some cutting-edge amazing product some company made.

But thatâ€™s not all about me. Another great passion I have is music. Nothing can make me feel the way music does, and nothingâ€™s better than plugging in the headphones late at night and listening to some great songs.

Finally, I should tell you about the sport of my life: basketball. Iâ€™ve played it since I was a kid, and the complexity and intensity of the sport is simply irreplaceable.

Thatâ€™s pretty much it ðŸ™‚ I hope that by making this blog I can inspire other people to do what I have always tried to do â€“ follow their dreams â€“ because that, I believe, is the true purpose of living.

Enjoy!
