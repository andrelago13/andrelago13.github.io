# Personal Projects

These are some of the projects I developed on my own or for my degree. There are much more projects I was a part of, but these are the ones I believe better represent my skills and knowledge.

## Voice Interaction Personal Assistant (ongoing)

* Java application running on a Raspberry Pi to interact with voice commands. Some functionalities are setting alarms and timers, scheduling reminders, switching on/off lights and weather forecast.
* Challenges: using design patterns that allow expansibility and using adaptive natural language processing.
* Technologies: Mostly Java, may use Prolog in the future, ([GitHub](https://github.com/andrelago13/JARVIS-Pi)).

# Academic Projects

* Itinerary calculator for a urban city with several means of transport (walk, taxi, bus, underground), that allows the user to specify separate priorities for time, distance and price of the journey.
* Challenges: calculating the weight of edges for the algorithms to do an effective evaluation of paths
* Technologies: C++, [GitHub](https://github.com/gtugablue/CAL-Planeamento-de-itinerarios-multimodais).

## Multiplayer and multi-device pool game (2 people team project)

Demo on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgp11t09ssc).

* Billiards game with Android devices as controllers and a desktop server playing the game itself.
* Challenges: developing fast yet efficient communication protocols to improve gameplay quality.
* Most important break-through: using TCP and UDP simultaneously, and using a heartbeat response system to detect user disconnection and allow reconnection.
* Technologies: Java, Eclipse, Android Studio, [GitHub](https://github.com/gtugablue/LPOOL), LibGDX.

## Multi-application store counter manager (2 people team project)

* Two Linux applications using shared memory to manage a store with several counters and clients.
* Challenges: using synchronization methods to prevent data loss, deadlocks and race conditions.
* Technologies: C, Linux, Eclipse, [GitHub](https://github.com/gtugablue/SOPE-Loja-Virtual).
