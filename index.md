Hello! My name is André Lago. I am a Software Engineer at Google Munich, where I work on building better privacy products for Google users across the world! Currently, I am the Tech Lead for [Activity Controls](myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols) and [Google Dashboard](myaccount.google.com/dashboard), two important privacy products that serve millions of Google users every single day.

I have a Master's in Informatics and Computing Engineering from the [Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto](fe.up.pt) which is located in my hometown of Porto, Portugal. I have loved technology since I can remember and I look forward to having an impact in the world through the dedication I put into my work.

This is my personal website, which is aimed towards displaying my professional and academic experience as well as my most important projects. The website also includes a blog which I use to share thoughts and experiences around what I do in my career.

You can reach me by [email](mailto:andrelago1995@gmail.com) or check out my profiles at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-lago/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/andrelago13).

# Work experience

## Google - Software Engineer - Munich, Germany (Oct 2018 - Present)

![Google](/assets/images/google.png)

Since I joined Google full-time I have been a member of the **Privacy and Data Protection Office** team. Our team works on both internal infrastructure, user-facing products and even open-source libraries that aim to provide users with better privacy tools for the products and technologies they use.

For the majority of my time at the team, I've worked on user-facing privacy products such as [Activity Controls](myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols), [Google Dashboard](myaccount.google.com/dashboard), [Takeout](takeout.google.com), [Privacy Checkup](myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup), [Your Data](myaccount.google.com/yourdata/maps) and [MyActivity](myactivity.google.com).

Currently, I am the Tech Lead for both [Activity Controls](myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols) and [Google Dashboard](myaccount.google.com/dashboard), which means I am responsible for the technical parts of these products, making sure that they keep serving our users properly and driving the technical design of larger features and projects that we work on. Since there are other engineers working on both of these products, I also need to supervise work done by them on the products to make sure that the code quality is good and meets our standards for these products.

The team has grown quite a bit since I joined, and the departure of some team members made me the second most senior engineer on the team, which has provided me great opportunities to mentor other colleagues and have a role with increased leadership.

Most of my technical work has been around Web Development, using mostly Java, Javascript and Go.

## Google – Software Engineering Intern - London, UK (2016) and Mountain View, USA (2017)

Before joining Google full-time, I did two Software Engineering Internships in 2016 and 2017 while I was still studying for my Master's.

For my first internship at Google London, I worked on the **Android for Work** team, on projects related to Android media and cross-user content access. I also got to work on public features released on Android O, particularly the ability for users to add custom ringtones from any audio file. This feature was reported in [an article by Android Police](http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/23/android-o-feature-spotlight-easily-add-custom-ringtones-alarm-sounds-notification-sounds/) and my commits can be seen under the public [AOSP GitHub mirror repository](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/commits/master/media/java/android/media/RingtoneManager.java). I also talked about the work done during this internship [in one of my blog posts](/blog/my-work-at-google).

Working on Android was very exciting for a lot of different reasons. First, it is a billion-user product, so knowing that my code would end up in the hands of so many people was thrilling. Also, I also loved the Android OS and its development environment, so being able to improve a product that I already loved made me even more passionate about the impact I made. Finally, knowing that my code had to be bullet-proof to security exploits made me have to focus on security a lot more, and think very well about how to implement features before actually coding them.

After my first internship at Google, I was offered a second Software Engineering internship, this time in Mountain View, California, in the company’s headquarters.

For this internship I was a part of the **People Team**, mainly working on the way contacts are uploaded for backup from Android devices. I worked on Android Google Play Services modules that perform the contact uploads to improve the way they are made, and also make them more reliable. I also got to work on server side solutions related to this, by developing an RPC service from scratch that performs deletion of user device contacts, and will soon receive traffic from all Android users.

## University of Porto – Teaching Assistant – 2015 to 2018

![FEUP](/assets/images/feup.png)

Since 2015 I have been a teaching assistant in several courses of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto, ranging from computer graphics or project management to low-level peripheral driver development. Specifically, I was a TA in the subjects of [Computer Laboratory](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=399888), [Graphical Computation](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=399891), [Laboratory of Graphical Interface Applications](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=399899), [Programming](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=399883) and [Software Development Laboratory](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=399910).

As a teaching assistant my job is to be present in the practical classes of the courses, helping other students by answering their questions withoud handing them the answers. They have to learn by doing!

# Education

## FEUP - Integrated Master's (BsC + MsC) in Informatics and Computing Engineering - 2013 to 2018

Average Grade: 18/20 points

Thesis Grade: 19/20 points

Throughout the Master's I have studied many different fields of software engineering, some of which particularly caught my interest. The main subjects I learned were distributed systems, mobile applications, software development methodologies, project management, software architecture and artificial intelligence.

Other subjects included operating systems, networks or web development.

My thesis dissertation project consisted on the development of a conversational assistant for the management of IoT smart spaces that is capable of performing more complex tasks than those of equivalent tools such as the Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. That project's code, as well as a scientific paper written about its results, can be found [here](https://github.com/andrelago13/jarvis).

Main languages learned on the Master's: Java, C++, Javascript, C#, C.
